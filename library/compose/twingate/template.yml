  description:
    "The Twingate Connector is a lightweight software component that establishes
    secure connections between your private network and the Twingate service. It acts
    as a bridge, allowing authorized users to access internal resources without exposing
    them directly to the internet. The Connector uses strong encryption and authentication
    mechanisms to ensure that all data transmitted between users and resources remains
    confidential and secure.
